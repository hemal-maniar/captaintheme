I’m Hemal — a security engineer focused on penetration testing and application security. As an OSCP-certified professional with additional certifications in Security+ and eJPT, I delve deep into penetration testing and offensive security. This site serves as a glimpse into my journey, where I’ll regularly share write-ups for Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and various VulnHub boxes, with the hope that you find them helpful in your own cybersecurity pursuits.

When I’m not immersed in cybersecurity, you can find me geeking out on a Counter-Strike server with friends or exploring other games. Beyond tech, I enjoy listening to music, cooking, sketching, and traveling. I’m also on a mission to stay more active—it's a work in progress!
